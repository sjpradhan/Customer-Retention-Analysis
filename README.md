# Insights :

- The cohorts consistently exhibit a 100% retention rate in the first month, indicating a strong initial engagement with the product or service.

- As the analysis progresses to subsequent months, there is a gradual decline in retention rates across cohorts. This suggests challenges in maintaining sustained customer interest over the long term.

- The cohorts display a 0% churn rate in the first month, indicating stability and retention of customers during the initial engagement period.

- There are variations in churn rates across different cohorts. Some cohorts maintain low churn rates, while others experience higher churn over time.

- The data highlights fluctuations in active customers, with peaks in November 2011, and a significant drop in December 2011, indicating a potential issue or seasonal trend. 

- Additionally, new customer acquisition varies each month, suggesting the need for targeted strategies to maintain or enhance customer growth. 

- The Churn pattern, particularly high in December 2011, highlights a potential area for improvement in customer retention strategies.

- The presence of Resurrected Customers in various months suggests efforts to re-engage with previous customers.
